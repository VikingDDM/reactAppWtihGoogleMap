We use lerna (https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to split the whole react-google-maps-api project into packages. To get started:
1. Clone repository
2. npm install
3. lerna bootstrap

Inside root folder you will find packages:
1. react-google-maps-api - this we are going to publish
2. storybook (https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) - for visual testing of our components
3. docz (https://www.docz.site/) - for documenting our code
