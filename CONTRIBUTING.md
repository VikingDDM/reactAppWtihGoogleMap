We use lerna (https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to split the whole @react-google-maps/api project into packages. To get started:

1. Clone repository
2. yarn
3. lerna bootstrap

Inside root folder you will find packages:
1. @react-google-maps/api - this we are going to publish
2. storybook (https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) - for visual testing of our components
3. docz (https://www.docz.site/) - for documenting our code
4. gatsby-example (https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues)
